# A-collaborative-eccoding-approach-for-MDD-using-sMRI-data
a customized collaborative training algorithm with a novel dual-branch parallel network architecture

This is the main code of our study, we will improve it continuously.

Res-Former is our proposed novel dual-branch network architecture for sMRI data.

Fed-Reg is main file for training personalized federated learning models for each participant institution, here we use the default parameters. The Reg_loss is the core loss function for collaborative training process, which contains the Federated Variational Distillation and Gradient Matching.

It's possible that this code may not accurately replicate the results outlined in the paper due to potential human errors during the preparation and cleaning of the code for release. If you encounter any difficulties in reproducing our findings, please don't hesitate to inform us. Additionally, we'll make an effort to carry out sanity-check experiments in the near future.
